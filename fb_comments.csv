1,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,"This is nothing but a revenue venture.   If a team is safely in the playoffs, the 17th game becomes a throw-away where all the starters play a series or two or are totally held out.   Oh wait, that's already the 16th game....Let's hold out ALL the starters for this one.   Unless it is a ""win and you are in"" game but come on.   I would rather they re-work the playoffs so it is the teams with the best records, period.   Get rid of the 8-8 or 7-9 team that makes the playoffs because they won a horrible division. "
2,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,I'd like to see an out of conference annual rivalry game.  Have us play Giants or Lions once a year every year.  Every team could have two options to go between to ensure a rivalry game every year.

4,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,For the players sake they should have another bye for safety!
5,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,"A better idea is a true ""throwback game.""   Throwback uniforms and original rules.   Officials are not allowed to arbitrarily call ""Unnecessary roughness,"" ""Roughing the passer,"" Drive-killing ""Pass Interference"" calls, or ""Illegal block in the back"" on every quality punt of kick return.   Officials are to be consistent.   If it's a penalty in the 1st Quarter, it is a penalty in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.   They are reminded that 66,000 fans are there to see the players play, not see them call the game."

12,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,"Make it 20 and put a cap on how many regular season games an individual player can play. That wouldn't put the players at any more risk for injury, more revenue for the league, more players can get exposure, and more strategy involved. Fans happier with a season that lasts longer."

334,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,Wish the bills would wear the early 90's helmet as a throwback.
335,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,"OK, So, I love the Bills but the standing buffalo is one the most boring team logos ever.   Of the ones pictured I think the best are Denver and TB. "

337,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,I love the bills but the throwback sucks. Bring back the red helmet
338,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,Oilers (the Titans) alternative logo. Don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôve always liked the color scheme and logo even though it‚Äôs not the definition of intimidating or cool

Getting every mini helmet was tough to do, but I got there. Without bringing in the like or dislike for the franchises, the team logos back then were so much better than today. My top 7 ( in no particular order ) were the Broncos, Eagles, Patriots, Oilers, Bills, Redskins and the blue and white Rams). I would love to see the NFL go back to 2-3 weeks of throwback jerseys-- bring back memories for those who are 50+.  "

364,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,My suggestion they should dedicate one week it doesn‚Äôt matter which one every year in the nfl where all the teams wear throwback uniforms for that week 
365,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,No doubt. But the old Patriots and Buccaneers was pretty cool too

652,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,Great addition in my opinion. This gives them 3 different type backs to use the 15% of the time they run the ball. Breida is dynamic but he's not rugged enough to be a full time back.

667,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,"I like this signing because we have no backs on the active roster that challenge a defense outside the tackles. I was kind of hoping for Tevin Coleman simply because his bigger and runs a solid 4.4 (40) he is also a  receiving threat out of the backfield, but has been injury prone the past two seasons. Anyhow, the Jets signed him today for a deal worth ""up to"" 2 mil...I still think Zak is the starter and should show significant improvement with a  returning O-line that really never played more than 7-8 games together. This signing should help keep defenses honest on the edges."

673,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Buffalo%20BIlls,Buffalo BIlls,In the three years he was at San Francisco .. Breida finished in the top 10 in the NFL in yards per attempt.  And remember while in San Fran he battled Tevin Coleman Alfred Morris and Raheem mostert for playing time. Not bad for an undrafted player.  He tore it up at Georgia Southern for two seasons then in his last year a new head coach totally changed the run offense

1761,https://m.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=Highmark,Highmark,They were going to call it Sabres Field but then they read the lease.   The Bills‚Äô lease agreement stipulates that the stadium name ‚Äúshall not unreasonably cause embarrassment to the County.‚Äù

If these bozos have so much money to spend on buying the rights to all the professional sports stadiums then why don‚Äôt they do us a favor and lower their fees for us???
